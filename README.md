# Multilayer-Perceptron

42 2020-Data-Science Project. Implementation of your own Neural Network system.

### Multilayer-Perceptron

Multilayer-Perceptron is an advanced project and the end of one the algorithmic/artificial intelligence branch at 42 Paris.
The goal of this project is to learn how does a Neural Network system works. Then you are asked to create your own Neural Network system Answering certain requirements such as
at least 2 hidden layers, a softmax layer on the output...

## Running the project

The project mark is : [Not delivered yet]

To test the project, you will have to first of all clone the repo.
2 different python scripts are waiting for you to launch.
Just don't forget to download the different libraries needed, the downloading of the data will be automatically done, if you don't have downloaded it already.

```
python train.py

python predict.py
```
